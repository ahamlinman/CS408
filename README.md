## Problem Statement
Because thousands of packages are delivered through the campus mail system every day, knowing where a package is and when it will arrive in this system will be of great convenience to all who use it.  Our intention is to produce an application that will allow on-campus residents and mailroom workers to easily manage and track packages using a fast, user-friendly interface.

### Objectives
* Create a web application using Java that will manage a database with information regarding residents and packages
* Allow mailroom workers to update the status of packages as they move through various stages of the campus mail system
* Notify residents of their packages status in the campus mail system via email, push notification, etc.
* Allow residents to log in to check the status of their package (ready for pickup at a certain location, in transit to another location, etc.)

### Stakeholders
* Users: Residents in on-campus housing and staff responsible for handling packages
* Developers: Matthew Tracy, Xiaojing Ji, Evan Arnold, Cris Shumate, Alex Hamlin
* Project Owners: Matthew Tracy, Xiaojing Ji, Evan Arnold, Cris Shumate, Alex Hamlin
* Project Manager: Matthew Tracy

### Deliverables
* Backend system which will maintain a database of packages, their locations in the campus mail system, the individual that each package is destined for, and contact information for individuals who may receive packages
* Frontend system that displays package locations and estimated delivery dates to residents, and allows mailroom workers to update package locations and statuses
